# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

üåê Project Overview

Solana Task Platform Frontend is a minimal and scalable frontend built with React + Vite, designed to serve as the user interface for a task-based dApp on the Solana blockchain.

Users will eventually be able to:

‚Ä¢	Connect their Phantom wallet
 
‚Ä¢	Browse and accept tasks
 
‚Ä¢	Interact with on-chain logic (in future development)

This repository focuses on frontend UI, with plans for full blockchain integration using @solana/web3.js.
